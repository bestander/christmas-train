## 3d-printed train project on Raspberry Pi Pico

![train](./train.gif)

Based on https://www.printables.com/model/268716.

I'll be iterating on this project around Christmas time each year because trains are festive.


## Project goals

- Tune 3d printed parts to make the drive more reliable
- Expose train controls to home automation for scheduled runs
